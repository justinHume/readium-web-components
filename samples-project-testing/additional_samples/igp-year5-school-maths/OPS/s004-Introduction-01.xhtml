         <div class="title-block-rw exclude-auto-rw" id="title-block12">


            <h1 id="h13">Introduction</h1>

         </div>

         <h2 id="h213">Purpose of this Book</h2>

         <p id="p3">This is a Mathematics interactive content demonstration book using standard long-arithmetic.</p>

         <p id="p187">It uses the <strong>ALL-IN</strong> (AZARDI Learning Library-Interactive Now!) arithmetic module for the instant implementation of long forms of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
         </p>

         <p id="p73">It's purpose is to allow education publishers to understand and evaluate the potential of ePub3 for creating education textbooks in a standard format rather than proprietary packages.</p>

         <p id="p20">This book must currently be used with the AZARDI ePub3 reading system as it has and uses ePub3 features not supported by any other ePub3 reading system.</p>

         <h2 id="h218">What You Will See</h2>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p21">This book shows the use of advanced presentation and interactive arithmetic as available from the standard <em>IGP:Digital Publisher</em> production application using straight-forward tagging patterns and "built-in" interactive options. This book is a fully valid ePub3 book.
         </p>

         <h3 id="h34">Arithmetic Presentation</h3>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p74">This book uses highly structured presentation arithmetic to ensure clear and consistent presentation of the arithmetic in every context.</p>

         <p id="p75">Accessibility is always important with our production and delivery systems so all equations and the body text fonts can be resized and the screen layout optimized for any requirement.</p>

         <h3 id="h35">Tutorial Interactivity</h3>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p76">Sliding panels are used for the Guided Practice tutorial exercises. This approach allows focus on the problem one step at a time with more detail that can generally be done in a print book, and&#160; with easy back and forward navigation to review the tutorial steps. These could also be animated and have audio included.</p>

         <h3 id="h36">Exercise Interactivity</h3>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p97">There are Exercises linked from each Guided Practice. Exercise pages can be of any size or quantity as print page limitations do not exist. They can also be graded for learning targets. The student can do the exercises mentally or on paper and immediately check the answer in the actual equation. There is no "turning to the answer page".</p>

         <p id="p98">In addition the Exercise pages can be downloaded as PDFs and printed for personal or classroom use. The Exercises have the answers on each print sheet.</p>

         <h3 id="h37">Interactive Practice</h3>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p99">Each of the four operation on numbers concepts (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) has an independent "fixed-layout" practice page. Here sums are generated automatically and the student can practice as much as they like or need.</p>

         <h3 id="h38">Test Yourself</h3>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p137">In a similar manner to the Interactive Practice, the independent Test Yourself fixed layout pages give 10 problems and then a mark. The fully module (not provided in this demonstration) allows review and reattempt of the wrong answers as a student works through their learning steps.</p>

         <h2 id="h221">Production Advantages</h2>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p22">Mathematics is always regarded as "challenging" in production; and it is. Even more so with digital content than print. The <em>IGP:Digital Publisher</em> approach delivers a suite of advantages not available in any other production system.
         </p>

         <p id="p188">It is built on rock-solid, tested, tagging patterns that can be shaped with CSS, enhanced with images and actioned with Javascript.</p>

         <p id="p189">The approach is designed for the world. Any and all languages. Any and all locale requirements.</p>

         <p id="p190">Because the content is always managed in <em>IGP:Digital Publisher</em> new publishing solutions are presented. Books can be incrementally updated with additional interactivity at any time.
         </p>

         <h2 id="h211">In this Book</h2>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p23">This book has a number of icon blocks that contain special information or resources.</p>

         <div class="block-rw general-rw exclude-auto-rw" id="general55">


            <div class="block-rw icon-rw iconinfo" id="icon9">


               <div class="pc-rw" id="pc1"><img alt="alt" src="images/icon-note-c.png"/></div>

               <h4 id="h42">INFORMATION</h4>

               <p id="p24">Information blocks contain production guidelines or instructions. These give information about the tools, content and interactions. These information blocks are not designed to be included in a final book.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="block-rw icon-rw iconvideo" id="icon1">


               <div class="pc-rw" id="pc4"><img alt="alt" src="images/icon-intractive-tutorials-c.png"/></div>

               </p>

               <p id="p30">In AZARDI this opens in a new controlled reader window (without URL bar) to control Internet access to online video resources.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="block-rw icon-rw iconexercise" id="icon10">


               <div class="pc-rw" id="pc2"><img alt="alt" src="images/icon-idea-c.png"/></div>

               <h4 id="h44">EXERCISE: TRY IT YOURSELF</h4>

               <p id="p33">A link to an exercises with interactive answers for the student to try.</p>

               <p id="p191">There is also a link to the printable PDF Exercise download page.</p>

               <p id="p34">There are links to online printable PDFs for each exercise if a teacher/student would like to have a printed version of any exercise.</p>

            </div>

         </div>

         <h2 id="h257">ePub3 Features Used in this Book</h2>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p192">This is a fixed layout ePub3 book using a full set of fixed layout spine properties. It uses reflowable and fixed layout pages as well as landscape only pages so will not work in iBooks or Readium.</p>

         <ul id="ul1" epub:type="list"><li id="li1"><strong>Lesson narratives and frontmatter</strong> are reflowable sections. They can be adjusted and optimized for your monitor and reading preferences with the AZARDI personalization tools.
            </li>
    
            <li id="li2"><strong>Interactive Practice and Interactive Test</strong> pages are fixed-layout landscape. They cannot be modified or changed by the user.
            </li>
    
            <li id="li3"><strong>Exercise pages</strong> are <strong>non-linear</strong> in the spine and <strong>not</strong> in the TOC. The reader skips these pages with previous/next navigation. They can only be entered and exited with page navigation links (or the return-button).
            </li>
    
            <li id="li4"><strong>Exercise pages and the AZARDI Help page</strong> use the experimental ePub3 spine property <span class="code-rw">rendition:layout-scrolling</span>. This instructs the reading system to present the pages in scrolling mode even if other sections have been customized for a multi-column view. Page Up and Page Down work on scrolling pages.
            </li>
